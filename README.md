Bike Rentals Simulation and Analysis
This repository contains Python code for simulating hourly bike rentals and ride durations over 10,000 days using Poisson and Exponential distributions, performing probability estimations, calculating statistical metrics, and generating visualizations to analyze rental and duration patterns.

Features
Simulates bike rentals per hour using Poisson distribution with hourly varying average rates mimicking real-world daily patterns.

Simulates ride durations using an Exponential distribution.

Calculates probabilities such as:

Probability that rentals exceed 10 in any hour.

Probability distribution over the maximum rentals observed at specific hours.

Probabilities related to ride duration intervals (e.g., rides longer than 30 minutes).

Computes key metrics: mean and variance of ride durations.

Generates seven different informative plots, including hourly rentals, rental trends, histograms, and smoothed density estimates of ride durations.
